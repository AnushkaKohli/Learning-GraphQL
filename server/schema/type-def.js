// why using input is helpful
// 1. if you don't want a particular field as argument, you can choose not to add it in the input
// for age: Int! in CreateUserInput, if age were an optional field, we could have chosen not to pass age while mutating or we could have passed a default value if nothing was passed like age: Int = 18
